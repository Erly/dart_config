description: 
  A set of libraries designed to provide configuration to Dart applications.
  Using dependency injection, the same library API can load config information
  from the filesystem and httprequest, formatted as JSON or YAML.  Customization 
  with additional providers is also possible by implementing 
  two simple interfaces.
